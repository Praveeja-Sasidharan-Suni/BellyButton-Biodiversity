# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Purpose
The purpose of this project is to create a web application dashboard using Javascript and Plotly to display belly button bacteria data from several different research volunteers.  
The dashboard has to be interactive where the user could select the Test Subject ID number and the dashboard would display the results for that specific ID number. 
 The results to be displayed are:

1. Demographic Information
2. Bar chart of the top 10 bacteria cultures found
3. Indicator chart of belly button washing frequency
4. Bubble chart of bacteria cultures per sample

## Resources
Data Source: samples.json </br>
Software: VS Code, Javascript (ECMAScript 6), Plotly, Bootstrap, d3, HTML

## Results

### Deliverable1

### Deliverable4

* Customized my dashboard with three of the following:
-Added an image to the jumbotron.
-Added background color or a variety of compatible colors to the webpage.
-Used a custom font with contrast for the colors.

* When the dashboard is first opened in a browser, ID 940’s data is displayed in the dashboard, and all three charts are working according to the requirements when a sample 
is selected from the dropdown menu.
